# Overview

My dad has early dementia and maybe early Alzheimer's disease. When he calls me, 99% of the time it's a desktop computer support question. He works on a Mac. These are easy to support, but when you have an older family member it can be difficult. This support site will give anyone a chance to survive a relative's distressed, panicked support call. Feel free to edit each page. This is meant for anyone to use to help facilitate and keep yopur sanity when you are answering the same questions day after day.
